### Fixed Bugs

-   I tried to put in a Christmas Song in the Background but due to autoplay policies tightening up this isn't possible. I was going to put in a click to play but i thought the song was quite annoying and would give the user a bad experience.
 <h2 align="center"><img src="assets/images/music-error.png"></h2>

-   When a user would click the card it would start the time but if they clicked another card it would increase the time faster. It has now been resovled.

-  When a user would match two cards it would score 1. but when they matched another two cards would stay at 1. This has also been resovled.
