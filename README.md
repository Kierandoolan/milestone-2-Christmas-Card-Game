       <h3 align="center"><img src="assets/images/form-lighthouse.png"></h3>



### Fixed Bugs (Do)

-   I tried to put in a Christmas Song in the Background but due to autoplay policies tightening up this isn't possible. I was going to put in a click to play but i thought the song was quite annoying and would give the user a bad experience.
 <h2 align="center"><img src="assets/images/"></h2>
To fixed this i deleted the image and downloaded it again at a bigger size which brought up the performance to 91.
 
- Had a issue with the form detail page that took me weeks to fix. Could not figure out why the form detail was taking up too much space. Found out with the help of a tutor that i had accidently put a style in for the radio button zumba that pushed it too the bottom as you can see in the next picture.
